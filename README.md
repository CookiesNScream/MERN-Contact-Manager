Introductory project into Javascript using MERN stack. 
There were a lot of challenges and learnings during the development project, but ultimately am proud with the result.
Tried to use industry wide best practices while developing. (Although react page structure could probably be done better)
Created and implemented all CRUD api types in the project.
